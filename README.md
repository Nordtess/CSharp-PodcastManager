💡 Description

OruMongoDB Podcast Manager is a complete end-to-end system for fetching, parsing, organizing and storing podcast feeds using:

WinForms for a responsive desktop GUI

MongoDB Atlas for cloud persistence

Asynchronous operations to keep the UI fast

Repository Pattern to abstract all data access

ACID MongoDB Transactions to guarantee atomic multi-write operations

A clean 4-layer architecture used in professional enterprise apps

The goal of the project is to demonstrate real backend engineering concepts such as:

Clean separation of responsibilities

Database-agnostic business logic

Transaction-safe write operations

Input validation & domain correctness

Systemized handling of RSS parsing, caching, and syncing

This project was developed as part of Örebro University's backend course, and showcases professional architectural patterns used in real software engineering.
